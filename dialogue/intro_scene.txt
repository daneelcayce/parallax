! Intro scene dialogue and stuff.

You've landed an interview at Elwood Electric -- a small tech company in Fernville, a little town not too far away from where you live. The job posting was a little vague -- but you have the qualifications, and honestly, which postings aren't a little vague, these days? It's worth a shot, anyway.

You've never actually been to Fernville before, and you're not really sure why. It's a cute little town, situated in a wooded valley. Lots of shops, a library, a park. You decide to stop off at a coffee shop on your way, since you have time.


BARISTA
"Haven't seen you around -- you new here?"

PLAYER
"Just here for a job interview."

BARISTA
"Ah, so... future-new-around-here. Where's the interview?"

PLAYER
"Elwood Electric. Some data entry job, I guess..."

She gives you a puzzled look for a moment.

BARISTA
"Really? I don't think I know anybody who works there."

BARISTA
"Actually, I thought the place was closed down. I never see anybody go in or out of that building. No cars in the parking lot or anything."
"When I was a kid, we used to think the place was haunted."
"What do they do over there, anyway?"

PLAYER
"I, uh... I'm actually not entirely sure."
"The job posting wasn't super clear. Tech jobs, y'know, they're all just a bunch of jargon strung together."

BARISTA
"Ha. Yeah. Seems like half the interview's just whether you can suss out what you're supposed to be doing."

PLAYER
"Feels that way."

BARISTA
"Here you go, hon. On the house."
"Call it an early welcome-to-town gift."

PLAYER
"Oh, thank you!"

BARISTA
"Mm-hmm. Good luck."
