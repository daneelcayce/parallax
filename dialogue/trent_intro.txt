SCENE 1: OFFICE

*door beep*

TRENT
"How did you get in here?"

PLAYER   
You hold up the keycard.
"I found this outside. It let me in."

TRENT  
"That isn't what I meant."
He points to the terminal.
"You aren't one of our programmers. You shouldn't have been able to log in."

PLAYER
"There was a login for me, in the printer room. It was weird, but..."

TRENT
"But you were curious."
You nod, slightly sheepishly.
"What's your name, kid?"
He studies you for a moment as you tell him, then sighs and shakes his head.
"It isn't safe here. She can't hear us, but if she got you into the system, then she knows you're here. Come on."

PLAYER
"What are you talking about? Who...?"

TRENT
"Alice, that's who."
He nearly spits out the name -- looking over his shoulder at the door for a moment. Listening for something.
"I'll explain on the way. Come on."

PLAYER
"Hang on a second. I don't even know who you *are* --"

TRENT
"My name's Trent."
"Right now, I'm your best shot at getting out of here alive. You're gonna have to trust me."
if (Notebook in player)
    His eyes flicker to the notebook in your hands.
    "I'm glad you found that. We're gonna need it."
else
    He glances toward the desk, then crosses the room and puts the notebook in his jacket pocket.
    "Better bring this with us. I think we're gonna need it."

TRENT
"Ready?"

YesOrNo();

if yes:
TRENT
"Good. Okay."

if no:
TRENT:
"Yeah, me either."

else (override message): continue

TRENT
"Come on. We don't have long."




SCENE 2 - HALLWAY -> ICE CAVE
(Note: eventually this will be interactive; the player will follow Trent through the hallway, down the stairs, and into the ice cave.)

Trent looks around for a second before nodding toward the end of the hall, opposite the way you came.

PLAYER
"Where are we going?"

TRENT
"One of the only safe places left around here. We've only got about five minutes before Alice figures out what's going on and sends somebody after us."

At the end of the hallway is a heavy, locked door, much like the others you've seen around here. Before you can reach for your keycard, Trent places a hand on the scanner.

The door unlocks, revealing a set of stairs.

TRENT
"Come on. This way."

And without quite knowing why, you follow him down a flight of stairs and through another locked door. But when the door opens, the forest and town are gone.
