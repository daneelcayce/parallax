# Parallax planning document

## Level ideas (not in order)
### Things that are outside the system
Intro -- the classic dirt road. The fork can take you to two different places (it won't matter which one you visit first.)

Office building.
    - It looks suspiciously like Cardiff Electric.
    - There's an angry peacock in the printer room, guarding a sheet of paper with some very important information on it.
    - You probably find a keycard that lets you into certain rooms. There's also a notebook with some intriguing (and later useful) information in it. We'll use that later to record our own findings as we go along.

Ominous forest.

A town where something's... not quite right. There's a lady who lives at the edge of town, and everyone's pretty sure she's a witch. She may or may not be helpful, or even benign.

Underground bunker, with all of the neat mysterious stuff inside. Could take inspiration from a _lot_ of things here. The important points:
    - There's a really old computer in there, of some variety. Powerful for the time Could be a System/370 mainframe, a VAX... or a bunch of SPARCstations.
    - It's clear that this place was set up by whoever owns the notebook; that's probably what leads you to it.
    - You get zapped into the system, somehow.



### Things that are inside the system
A maze of mirrors -- inspired by the level Cameron mentions in Halt.

A pocket dimension inside a mirror, which tries to kill you.
    - Yes, this is kind of taken from Tron, but in fairness, there might not be anyone in there specifically! It might just be the environment!

MAYBE: A sprawling research station, focusing on robotics. The back end of this is a factory. The robots are probably evil.

A city that serves as the central hub for most of the locations here -- this will be fairly open-world in nature, but you'll probably get a side-quest or two with special areas/locked doors/etc.

An expansive tower, apparently abandoned. It all feels... heavy.
    - The Hall of Legends is probably here, although I don't think I'll put it in the prototype.
    - You'll find out who the notebook's owner is, here. There's a holographic recording of him, and information about him gets added to your database. It also adds information about someone else.
    - This guy? _Many_ different characters coming together here.
    - The other person is the creator of the system, and she is _definitely_ not Cameron Howe, nope.

The Great Forest. It's magnificent and definitely not haunted.

The sea, and then a house on an island. This is where you meet the creator of the system -- and no, she's not stuck here. But she's not leaving, either.

Ice Cave. This is where the owner of the notebook lives.



## Miscellaneous world/story elements, eventually
A bear fight, somewhere. Maybe. If you're very unlucky in the haunted forest.

An electromechanical moose, obviously.
    - Moose Awareness Code.

Pretty sure we're gonna get into the pocket dimension by literally falling in _(yes, I know, shut up)._ Possibly via mirror in the maze, but it could be another way.

Random Furbys. For reasons.
    - Reprogrammable to do interesting and helpful things?
    - Should you have a companion Furby, kind of like a Bit?

"Various objects you'll pick up in places", an incomplete list:
    - orange soda
    - floppy disks, possibly how we acquire new datasets
    - tin cans

Laser weapons, or something similar. Possibly formalized turn-based combat level. Some jackass takes something from you and you fight them to get it back.
    - No idea how this works in a text-based environment, but that could be the fun part.

## Character ideas
A cranky, but kind, mathematician/scientist/etc who teaches you something important.
    - He turns out to be the owner of the notebook. Because I've _never_ seen that done in anything, ever. And he totally isn't partially inspired by that guy, nope.
    - Note that he didn't _create_ this system. But he worked with the woman who did, and helped her maintain it.
    - I'm debating on whether I want him to come along with you after you meet him.

Alice, Bob, Carol, Eve, and Mallory.
    - Also Trent. Unless that (or similar) is actually the mathematician guy's name. He could absolutely be the trusted third party.
    - Mallory and Eve might be our villains here.

More _Totally-Not-That-Person_ characters who could show up briefly:
    - Yo-Yo and Lev
    - Joe Macmillan
    - Rhyme and Alec
    - Mara


## Questions to deal with as we go
What's the deal with the system anyway?
    - Why was it built?
    - How the hell do I keep it from basically just being the Grid? Or should I just lean into it?
