This will be a loosely-sci-fi Z-machine game, written in Inform 6. It's inspired by text adventures like Zork, Advent, and Dunnet -- as well as all the properly weird sci-fi and fantasy I read and watched as a kid. The basic concept is probably best described as _"Gravity Falls meets Tron, by way of Colossal Cave Adventure."_

My primary goals for the game jam are to have a prototype that is:
    - ...semi-playable, with a basic story.
    - ...accessible to Blind and cognitively-Disabled folks.
    - ...able to fit on a floppy disk (and run under DOS).
    - ...utterly ridiculous.

The name _Parallax_ comes a (fictional) text adventure in the TV series _"Halt and Catch Fire",_ which is another major, although indirect, inspiration behind this nonsense.
