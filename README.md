Parallax will be a loosely-sci-fi text adventure game. It's inspired by text adventures like Zork, Advent, and Dunnet -- as well as all the properly weird sci-fi and fantasy I read and watched as a kid. The basic concept is probably best described as _"Gravity Falls meets Tron, by way of Colossal Cave Adventure and/or The Castle of Dr. Brain."_

My primary goals for this game, in the long run, are to have a game that is:
- ...accessible to Blind and cognitively-Disabled folks.
- ...able to fit on a floppy disk (and run under DOS).
- ...utterly ridiculous.

The name _Parallax_ comes a (fictional) text adventure in the TV series _"Halt and Catch Fire",_ which is another major, although indirect, inspiration behind this nonsense.

The original prototype was written in Inform 6 as a Z-machine game. That version is full of bugs, and probably _just barely_ playable.

As of August 2021, I'm in the process of deciding whether to continue with Inform or move over to a different language/engine; this is a decision I'll probably make once I have a more expanded story locked down.
