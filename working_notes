5 May:
Adding office rooms, will connect and add objects etc later.
Should actually add a stairwell object or something as a door?

Terminal: shouldn't be able to take it, does it have light? how do I make it dim etc?

Need to make it so "unlock" and "open" are basically synonyms, the office building will get super tedious otherwise.
