Adding office rooms, will connect and add objects etc later.
Should actually add a stairwell object or something as a door?

Terminal: shouldn't be able to take it, does it have light? how do I make it dim etc?

Need to make it so "unlock" and "open" are basically synonyms, the office building will get super tedious otherwise.


8 May:
Moved some old macguffin engine code over. Keeping the name because it's magnificent (although "Parallax engine" is also cool, this feels more distinctive). Printer room and peacock, the peacock will need a basic life routine.

I actually think that since I've got everything up to the server room, I'll start expanding things out now. The prototype needs to end somewhere, after all, and starting this off with some mystery about "notebook guy" (he really needs a name...) will give me a good base to go from.
